# Swarm Intelligence Projects

This repository contains various implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms. These algorithms are inspired by the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, such as bird flocks or ant colonies, and are used to solve complex optimization problems.

## Projects

1. **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Path Planning**
   - Description: A PSO-based approach for optimizing the path of mobile robots in a dynamic environment.
   - [Link to Project](./PSO_Path_Planning)

2. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**
   - Description: Solves the classic TSP using the ant colony optimization algorithm to find the shortest path.
   - [Link to Project](./ACO_TSP)

3. **PSO for N-Queen Problem**
   - Description: Uses PSO to solve the N-Queen problem by optimizing the placement of queens on the chessboard.
   - [Link to Project](./PSO_NQueen)

4. **Firefly Algorithm for Function Optimization**
   - Description: Implements the Firefly Algorithm to find the global optimum of complex mathematical functions.
   - [Link to Project](./Firefly_Optimization)
