# Swarm Intelligence Projects

This repository contains various implementations of swarm intelligence algorithms. These algorithms are inspired by the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, such as bird flocks or ant colonies, and are used to solve complex optimization problems.

## Projects

1. [**Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for Path Planning**](./PSO_Mobile_Robot_Path_Planning)
   - Description: A PSO-based approach for optimizing the path of mobile robots in a dynamic environment.

2. [**PSO for N-Queen Problem**](./PSO_NQueen_Problem)
   - Description: Uses PSO to solve the N-Queen problem by optimizing the placement of queens on the chessboard.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArashAzhand/Swarm_Intelligence.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and follow the instructions in each projectâ€™s README.
